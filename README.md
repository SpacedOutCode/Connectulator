# Connectulator

This is a website that allows the user to upload files to their calculators
using WebUSB. No complicated installation instructions, just open the website,
follow the three on-screen steps and you're done.

## Status of this website

This website is currently very experimental. I have successfully communicated
with my TI-84 Plus with it, and sent files to it. However, it comes with
absolutely no guarantees that it can handle other models or even other version
of the TI-84 Plus, nor that it can properly parse and send any file you throw at
it. So be warned.

If you run into issues, please
[report them](https://github.com/Timendus/ticalc-usb/issues/new) or submit a PR
at the [`ticalc-usb` library](https://github.com/Timendus/ticalc-usb).
